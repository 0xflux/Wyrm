# C2_transfer

This directory is used for transferring tools into the C2. Simply drop tools in here you wish to execute remotely through
in memory commands, such as `dotex`.

After this commit, the folder is not tracked in git, so you do not have to worry about things in here being lost from 
updates.

So, say you drop Rubeus.eze in here, you can run `dotex Rubeus.exe ...` for example.
